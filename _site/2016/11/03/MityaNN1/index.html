<article class="post-content">
  <p>Inventors of the original artificial neural networks (NNs) derived their inspiration from biology. 
However, as artificial NNs progressed, their design was less guided by neuroscience facts. 
Meanwhile, progress in neuroscience has altered our conceptual understanding of neurons. 
Consequently, we believe that many successful artificial NNs resemble natural NNs only
superficially violating fundamental constraints imposed by biological hardware.</p>

<p>The wide gap between the artificial and natural NN designs raises intriguing questions: What 
algorithms underlie natural NNs? Can insights from biology help build better artificial 
NNs?</p>

<p>This is the first of a series of posts aimed at explaining recent progress made
by my collaborators and myself towards biologically plausible NNs. Such networks can 
serve both as models of natural NNs and as general 
purpose artificial NNs. We have found that respecting biological constraints 
actually helps development of artificial NNs by guiding design decisions.</p>

<p>In this post, I cover the background material, going back several decades. 
I sketch a biological neuron, introduce primary biological constraints, and discuss 
the conventional approach to deriving artificial NNs. I will show that while 
the conventional approach generates a reasonable algorithmic model of a <em>single</em> 
biological neuron, multi-neuron networks violate biological constraints. In future 
posts we will see how to fix that.</p>

<h2 id="a-sketch-of-a-biological-neuron">A Sketch of a Biological Neuron</h2>

<p>Here is the minimum biological background needed to understand the rest of the post.</p>

<p>A biological neuron receives signals from multiple neurons, computes their weighted sum and 
generates a signal transmitted to multiple neurons, Figure 1. Each neuron’s signaling activity is 
quantified by the <em>firing rate</em>, which is a nonnegative real number that varies over time. Each synapse 
scales the input from the corresponding upstream neuron onto the receiving neuron by its 
weight. The receiving neuron sums scaled inputs, i.e. computes the inner product of the 
upstream activity vector and the synaptic weight vector. The inner product passes 
through a nonlinearity called the activation function and the output is transmitted 
to downstream neurons.</p>

<p>Synaptic weight changes over time, typically, on a slower time scale than neuronal signals. The 
weight depends on neuronal signals per so-called learning rules. For example, in commonly 
used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebbian_theory">Hebbian learning rules</a>, synaptic weight is 
proportional to the correlation between the activities of the two neurons a synapse connects, 
i.e. pre- and postsynaptic.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=0B5Pfjcu55RQQb0F1MllnRTdweDQ" alt="" title="Title" />
Figure 1: A biological neuron modelled by an online algorithm. Left: A biological neuron receives 
inputs from the upstream neurons (green) which are scaled by the weights of corresponding 
synapses (blue). The neuron (black) computes output, $y$, as a function of the weighted input sum. Right: Online algorithm outputs an activation function of the inner product of the 
synaptic weight vector and an upstream activity vector. Synaptic weights are modified by 
neuronal activities (dashed line) per learning rules.</p>

<h2 id="primary-biological-constraints">Primary Biological Constraints</h2>

<p>To determine which algorithmic models in this post are biologically plausible, 
we can focus on a few key biological constraints.</p>

<p>Biologically plausible algorithms must be formulated in the <strong>online</strong> (or streaming), rather than 
offline (or batch), setting. This means that input data are streamed to the algorithm 
sequentially, one sample at a time, and the corresponding output must be computed before 
the next input sample arrives. The output communicated to downstream neurons cannot be 
modified in the future. A neuron cannot store individual past inputs or outputs except in a 
highly compressed format limited to synaptic weights and a few state variables.</p>

<p>In biologically plausible NNs, learning rules must be <strong>local</strong>. This means that the synaptic weight 
update may depend on the activities of only the two neurons a synapse connects, as for 
example, in Hebbian learning. Activities of other neurons are not physically available to a 
synapse and therefore including them into learning rules would be biologically
implausible. Modern artificial NNs, such as 
backpropagation-based deep learning networks, rely on nonlocal learning rules.</p>

<p>Our initial focus is on <strong>unsupervised</strong> learning. This is not a hard constraint, but rather a matter of 
priority. Whereas humans are clearly capable of supervised learning, most of our learning tasks 
lack big labeled datasets. On the mechanistic level, most neurons lack a clear supervision signal.</p>

<h2 id="single-neuron-online-principal-component-analysis-pca">Single-neuron Online Principal Component Analysis (PCA)</h2>

<p>In 1982, <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/38bc/c5d342accf5249514cdfdaaa40871a93252c.pdf">Oja proposed</a>
modeling a neuron by an online PCA algorithm. PCA is a workhorse of data
analysis used for dimensionality reduction, denoising, and latent factor 
discovery. Therefore, Oja’s seminal paper established that biological processes in 
a neuron can be viewed as the steps of an online algorithm solving a useful 
computational objective.</p>

<p>Oja’s single-neuron online PCA algorithm works as follows. At each time step, $t$, 
it receives an input data sample, ${\bf x_t}$, computes and outputs 
the corresponding top principal component value, $y_t$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">y_t \leftarrow {\bf w} _{t-1}^\top {\bf x}_t. \qquad \qquad \qquad (1.1)</script>

<p>Here and below lowercase boldfaced letters designate vectors. Then the algorithm updates the 
(normalized) feature vector,</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\bf w} _t \leftarrow {\bf w} _{t-1}+ \eta ( {\bf x} _t- {\bf w} _{t-1} y_t  ) y_t. \qquad \qquad (1.2)</script>

<p>The feature vector, ${\bf w}$, converges to the eigenvector of input covariance if data are drawn i.i.d from 
a stationary distribution.</p>

<p>The steps of the Oja algorithm (1.1-1.2) correspond to the operations of the biological neuron. If the 
input vector is represented by the activities of the upstream neurons, (1.1) represents weighted 
summation of the inputs by the output neuron. If the activation function is linear the output, $y_t$,
is simply the weighted sum. The update (1.2) is a local Hebbian synaptic learning rule. The 
first term of the update is proportional to the correlation of the pre- and postsynaptic neurons’ 
activities and the second term, also local, normalizes the synaptic weight vector.</p>

<h2 id="a-normative-theory">A Normative Theory</h2>

<p>Next, we would like to build on Oja’s insightful identification of biological 
processes with the steps of the online PCA algorithm by computing multiple 
principal components using multi-neuron NNs and including the activation nonlinearity.</p>

<p>Instead of trying to extend the Oja model heuristically, we take a more 
systematic, so-called normative approach. In this approach, a biological 
model is viewed as the solution of an optimization problem. Specifically, we 
postulate an objective function motivated by a computational principle, 
derive an online algorithm optimizing such objective, and map the steps 
of the algorithm onto biological processes.</p>

<p>Having such normative theory allows us to navigate through the space of 
possible algorithmic models in a more efficient and systematic way. Mathematical
compactness of objective functions facilitates generating new models and 
weeding out inconsistent ones. This is similar to the Hamiltonian approach
in physics which leverages natural symmetries and safeguards against the violation
of the first law of thermodynamics (energy conservation).</p>

<h2 id="deriving-a-single-neuron-online-pca-using-the-reconstruction-approach">Deriving a Single-neuron Online PCA using the Reconstruction Approach</h2>

<p>To build a normative theory, we first need to derive Oja’s single-neuron online algorithm by 
solving an optimization problem. What objective function should we choose for online PCA? 
Historically, neural activity has been often viewed as representing each data sample, ${\bf x}_t$, by the 
feature vector, ${\bf w}$, scaled by the output, $y_t$, Figure 2. Such reconstruction approach is naturally 
formalized as the minimization of the reconstruction (or coding) error:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min_{\| {\bf w} \|=1} {\sum \limits_{t=1}^{T} \min_{ y_t} {\| {\bf x}_t-{\bf w} y_t \| ^2_2}}. \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad (1.3)</script>

<p>In the offline setting, optimization problem (1.3) is solved by PCA: the optimum ${\bf w}$  is the 
eigenvector of input covariance corresponding to the top eigenvalue and the optimum output, $y$, is the first principal component.</p>

<p><img src="https://docs.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=0B5Pfjcu55RQQaUtLTmFmbjZ3eWs" alt="" /></p>

<p>Figure 2. PCA represents data samples (circles) by their projections (red) onto the top 
eigenvector, ${\bf w}$. These projections constitute the top principal component. Objective (1.3) 
minimizes the reconstruction error (blue).</p>

<p>In the online setting, (1.3) can be solved by alternating minimization, which has been a subject 
of <a href="http://www.offconvex.org/2016/05/08/almostconvexitySATM/">recent analysis</a>. After the arrival of each data point, <script type="math/tex">{\bf x}_t</script> , the algorithm computes optimum 
output, $y_t$, while keeping the feature vector, ${\bf w}_{t-1}$, computed at the previous time step, fixed. 
By using calculus, one finds that the optimum output is given by (1.1). Then, the algorithm 
minimizes the total reconstruction error with respect to the feature vector while keeping all the 
outputs fixed. Again, resorting to calculus, one finds (1.2).</p>

<p>Thus, the single-neuron online PCA algorithm may be derived using the reconstruction approach. To 
compute multiple principal components, we need to extend this success to multi-neuron 
networks.</p>

<h2 id="the-reconstruction-approach-fails-for-multi-neuron-networks">The Reconstruction Approach Fails for Multi-neuron Networks</h2>

<p>Though the reconstruction approach yields a multi-component online PCA 
algorithm, the corresponding NNs are <em>not</em> biologically plausible.</p>

<p>Extension of the reconstruction error objective from single to multiple output components is 
straightforward - each scalar, $y_t$, is replaced by a vector, ${\bf y}_t$:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\min_{\rm diag({\bf W}^\top {\bf W})={\bf I}} {\sum \limits_{t=1}^{T} \min_{ {\bf y}_t} {\| {\bf x}_t-{\bf W} {\bf y}_t \| ^2_2}}. \qquad \qquad \qquad \quad (1.4)</script>

<p>Here matrix ${\bf W}$ comprises column-vectors corresponding to different features. As in the single-
neuron case this objective can be optimized online by alternating minimization. After the arrival 
of data sample, ${\bf x}_t$, the feature vectors are kept fixed while the objective (1.4) is minimized 
with respect to the principal components by iterating the following update until convergence:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\bf y}_t \leftarrow {\bf W} _{t-1}^\top {\bf x}_t - {\bf W} _{t-1}^\top {\bf W} _{t-1} {\bf y}_t . \qquad \qquad \qquad (1.5)</script>

<p>Minimizing the total objective with respect to the feature vectors for fixed principal 
components yields the following update:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">{\bf W} _t \leftarrow {\bf W} _{t-1}+ \eta ( {\bf x} _t- {\bf W} _{t-1} {\bf y}_t ) {\bf y}_t^\top  \cdot \qquad \qquad (1.6)</script>

<p>As before, in NN implementations of algorithm (1.5-1.6), feature vectors are represented by 
synaptic weights and principal components by the activities of output neurons. Then (1.5) can 
be implemented by a single-layer NN, Figure 3, in which activity dynamics converges 
faster than the time interval between the arrival of successive data samples.</p>

<p>However, implementing update (1.6) in the single-layer NN architecture, Figure 3, requires 
nonlocal learning rules making it biologically implausible. Indeed, the last term in (1.6) implies 
that updating the weight of a synapse requires the knowledge of output activities of all other 
neurons which are not available to the synapse. Moreover, the matrix of lateral connection 
weights, $- {\bf W} _{t-1}^\top {\bf W} _{t-1}$, in the last term of (1.5) is computed as a Grammian of feedforward weights, 
clearly a nonlocal operation. This problem is not limited to PCA and arises in networks of 
nonlinear neurons as well.</p>

<p>Rather than deriving learning rules from a principled objective, many authors 
constructed biologically plausible single-layer networks using local learning 
rules, Hebbian for feedforward and anti-Hebbian (meaning there is a minus sign 
in front of the correlation-based synaptic weight as for the last term in (1.5)). 
However, in my view, abandoning the normative approach creates more problems 
than it solves.</p>

<p>Figure 3. The single-layer NN implementation of the multi-neuron online PCA algorithm derived 
using the reconstruction approach requires nonlocal learning rules.</p>

<p>I have outlined how the conventional reconstruction approach fails to generate 
biologically plausible multi-neuron networks for online PCA. In the next post, 
I will introduce an alternative approach that overcomes this limitation. 
Moreover, this approach suggests a novel view of neural computation leading to 
many interesting extensions.</p>
