<article class="post-content">
  <p>The language of dynamical systems is the preferred choice of scientists to model a wide variety of phenomena in nature. The reason is  that, often, it is easy to  <em>locally</em> observe or understand what happens to a system in one time-step. Could we then piece this local information together to make deductions about the  <em>global</em> behavior of these dynamical systems? The hope is to understand some of nature’s algorithms and, in this quest, unveil new algorithmic techniques. In this first of a series of posts, we give a gentle introduction to dynamical systems and explain what it means to view them from the point of view of optimization.</p>

<h2 id="dynamical-systems-and-the-fate-of-trajectories">Dynamical Systems and the Fate of Trajectories</h2>
<p>Given a system whose state at time $t$ takes a value $x(t)$ from a domain $\Omega,$ a dynamical system over $\Omega$ is a function $f$ that describes how this state evolves: one can write the update as 
[ \frac{dx(t)}{dt} = f(x(t))    \ \ \  \mathrm{or} \ \ \ x(t+1)=x(t) + f(x(t))] 
 in continuous or discrete time respectively. In other words, $f$ describes  what happens  in one unit of time to each point in the domain $\Omega.$ Classically, to study a dynamical system is to study  the eventual fate of its <em>trajectories</em>, i.e., the paths traced by successive states of the system starting from a given state. For this question to make sense, $f$ must not take any state out of the domain. However,  a priori, there is nothing to say that $x(t)$ remains in $\Omega$ beyond $x(0).$  This is the problem of  <em>global existence</em> of trajectories and can sometimes be quite hard  to establish. Assuming that the dynamical system at hand has a solution for all times   for all starting points, and $\Omega$ is compact, the trajectories either tend to  <em>fixed points</em>, <em>limit cycles</em> or end up in  <em>chaos</em>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
<img src="/assets/trajectories.jpg" alt="The fate of trajectories" />
</p>

<p>A fixed point of a dynamical system, as the name suggests, is a state $x \in \Omega$ which does not change on the application of $f$, i.e.,  $f(x)=0.$  A  fixed point is said to be <em>stable</em> if trajectories starting at <em>all</em> nearby points eventually converge to it and <em>unstable</em> otherwise. Stability is a property that one might expect to find in nature. Limit cycles are closed trajectories with a similar notion of stability/unstability, while limits of trajectories which are neither fixed points or limit cycles are (loosely) termed as chaos.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-dynamical-systems-optimize">What do Dynamical Systems Optimize?</h2>

<p>For now, we will consider the class of dynamical systems which only have fixed points, possibly many. In this setting, one can define a function $F$ which maps an  $x \in \Omega$  to its limit under the repeated application of $f.$ Note that to make this function well-defined we might have to look at the closure of $\Omega.$  This brings us to  the following broad,  admittedly not well-defined and widely open question that we would like to study:</p>

<p><strong>Given a dynamical system $(\Omega,f)$, what is  $F$?</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When $f$ happens to be the negative gradient of  a convex function $g$ over some convex domain $\Omega,$ the dynamical system $(\Omega,f)$ is nothing but an implementation of gradient descent to find the minimum of $g$, answering our question perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, in many cases, $f$ may not be a gradient system and understanding what $f$ optimizes may be quite difficult. The fact that there may be multiple  fixed-points necessarily means that trajectories starting at different points  may converge to different points in the domain– giving us a sense of non-convexity. In such cases, answering our question can be a daunting task and, currently, there is no general theory for it. We present two dynamical systems from nature – one easy and one not 	quite.</p>

<h2 id="evolution-and-the-largest-eigenvector">Evolution and the Largest Eigenvector</h2>

<p>As a simple but important example, consider a population consisting of $n$-types which is subject to the forces of evolution and held at a constant size, say one unit  of mass. Thus, if we let $x_i(t)$ denote the fraction of type $i$ at time $t$ in the population, the domain becomes 
$\Delta^n=\{x \in \mathbb{R}^n_{&gt;0}: x \geq 0 \; \mathrm{and} \; \; \sum_i x_i=1 \},$  the unit simplex. 
The update  function is<br />
[ f(x)= Qx - \Vert Qx \Vert_1 \cdot x ]
for a positive matrix  $Q \in \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}^{n \times n}.$ 
The properties of a natural environment in which the population is evolving can be captured by a matrix $Q,$  see this <a href="https://books.google.ch/books?id=YXrIRDuAbE0C&amp;hl=en">textbook</a> which is dedicated to the study of such dynamical systems. Mathematically, to start with, note that $f$ maps any point in the simplex to a point in the simplex.  Thus, starting at any point in $\Delta^n,$ the trajectory remains in $\Delta^n.$ What are the fixed points of $f$? These are vectors $x \in \Delta^n$ such that $Qx=\Vert Qx \Vert_1 \cdot x$ or the eigenvectors of $Q.$ Since $Q&gt;0,$ the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perron%E2%80%93Frobenius_theorem">Perron-Frobenius theorem</a>  tells us that $Q$ has unique  eigenvector $v \in \Delta^n$ and, starting at any $x(0) \in \Delta^n,$ $x(t) \rightarrow v$ as $t \rightarrow \infty.$ Thus, in this case, simple linear algebra can allow us to deduce that $f$ has exactly one fixed point and, thus, we can answer what is $f$ achieving globally: $f$ is nothing but nature’s implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration">Power Method</a> to compute the maximum eigenvector of $Q$! Biologically, the  corresponding eigenvalue can be shown to be the <em>average fitness</em> of the population which is what nature is trying to maximize. It may be worthwhile to note that the maximum eigenvalue problem is non-convex as such.</p>

<h2 id="solving-linear-programs-by-molds">Solving Linear Programs by Molds?</h2>

<p>Let us conclude with an interesting dynamical system inspired by the inner workings of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czk4xgdhdY4">slime mold</a>; see <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-642-30870-3_35">here</a> for a discussion on how this class of dynamics was discovered. Suppose $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times m}$ is a matrix and $b \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a vector. The domain is the positive orthant $\Omega = \{x \in \mathbb{R}{^m}: x&gt;0 \}.$ For a point $x \in \mathbb{R}^m,$ let $X$ denote the diagonal matrix such that $X_{ii}=x_i.$  The evolution function  is then:
[ \frac{dx}{dt} = X ( A^\top (AXA^\top)^{-1} b - \vec{1}), ]
where $\vec{1}$ is the vector of all ones.  Now the problem of existence of a solution is neither trivial nor can be ignored as, for the dynamical system to make sense, $x$ has to be positive. Further, it can be argued in a formal sense that this dynamical system is not a gradient descent. What then can we say about the trajectories of this dynamical system? As it turns out, it can be <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07020">shown</a> that starting at any $x&gt;0,$ the dynamical system is a gradient descent on a natural Riemannian manifold and converges to a unique point among the solutions to the following linear program,
[ \min \; \sum_i x_i \ \ \  \mathrm{s.t.} \ \ \ Ax=b, \ \ x \geq 0, ] 
which gives us a new algorithm for linear programming. We will explain how in a subsequent post.</p>
